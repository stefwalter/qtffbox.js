This is a set of extensions to [MP4Box.js](https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js/) to handle Quicktime, QTFF (aka .MOV) files. 
These extensions are very incomplete, and at present only support parsing certain types of metadata field (ie: "meta" atoms).

The MPEG-4 standards such as ISOMBFF have some basis in the QuickTime file format. 
Although there is commonality, these are distinct file types and standards:

 * QuickTime: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicktime-file-format
 * MPEG-4: https://www.mpeg.org/standards/MPEG-4/12/

This project is open to being merged into MP4Box.js, but appears beyond that projects scope. 
Thus the code style and dependencies should match MP4Box.js.
This is a project for contributors to share code around using MP4Box.js for QuickTime.
Issues or support requests opened without a related pull request (ie: contribution) will be closed.
